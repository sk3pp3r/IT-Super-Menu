Many times technical IT people are faced with a lot of daily and routine tasks that require us to repeat specific commands or perform various actions that just repeat themselves over and over again. The list of potential repeating tasks is never ending, and can contain stuff such as checking connectivity to a machine, resolving a host name, running a task on a remote machine, killing a process on a remote machine, resetting a user’s password in AD, renaming a user’s computer, checking a machine’s IP configuration and much much more.

IT Super Menu is HelpDesk/IT Menu script written by Haim Cohen.
It’s a nice, easy to understand, and very easy-to-modify script that’s written in plain, good old command prompt style. 
It contains around 20 or so of those frequently used tasks that many IT and help desk professionals may need to use
